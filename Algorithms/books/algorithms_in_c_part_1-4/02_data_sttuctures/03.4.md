With arrays and structures, we save an item in memory and later refer to it by name (or by index); with linked lists, the manner in which we save information makes it more difficult to access but easier to rearrange. 

Working with data that are organized in linked lists is called *list processing*.

## 1 Definition

**Definition 3.3 ** *A linked list is either a null link or a link to a node that contains an item and a link to a linked list*.

This definition is more restrictive than [**definition 3.2**](03.3.md/#Definition), but it corresponds more closely to the mental model that we have when we write list-processing code.

## 2 List Processing

### 2.1 Traverse

One of the common operations that we perform on lists is to *traverse* them: We scan through the items on the list sequentially, performing some operation on each.

For example, if `x` is a pointer to the first node of a list, the final node has a null pointer, and `visit` is a function that takes an item as an argument: 

```c
for (t = x; t != NULL; t = t->next) {
    visit(t->item);
}
```

 This loop is as ubiquitous in list-processing programs as is the corresponding `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)` in array-processing program.
