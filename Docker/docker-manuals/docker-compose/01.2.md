# Get Started

本节代码参见[compose-test]()

## 1. Prerequisites

首先安装 `Docker Compose` ,

```sh
$ pacman -S docker-compose
```

## 2. Setup

Define the application dependencies

1. Create a directory for the proejct:

   ```sh
   import time
   
   import redis
   from flask import Flask
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)
   
   def get_hit_count():
       retries = 5
       while True:
           try:
               return cache.incr('hits')
           except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
               if retries == 0:
                   raise exc
               retries -= 1
               time.sleep(0.5)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       count = get_hit_count()
       return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
   ```

2. Create a file `app.py` :

   ```python
   import time
   
   import redis
   from flask import Flask
   
   app = Flask(__name__)
   cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)
   
   def get_hit_count():
       retries = 5
       while True:
           try:
               return cache.incr('hits')
           except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
               if retries == 0:
                   raise exc
               retries -= 1
               time.sleep(0.5)
   
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       count = get_hit_count()
       return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
   ```

   In this example, `redis` is the hostname of the redis container on the application’s network. We use the default port for Redis, `6379`.

   > ### Handling transient errors
   >
   > Note the way the `get_hit_count` function is written. This basic retry loop lets us attempt our request multiple times if the redis service is not available. This is useful at startup while the application comes online, but also makes our application more resilient if the Redis service needs to be restarted anytime during the app’s lifetime. In a cluster, this also helps handling momentary connection drops between nodes.
   
3. Create file `requirements.txt` :

   ```
   flask
   redis
   ```

## 3. Create a Dockerfile

Write a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image. The imge contains all the dependencies the Python application requires, including Python iteself.

In project directory, create a file `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

This tells Docker to: 

- Build an image starting with Python 3.7 image
- Set the working directory to `/code` (会自动创建)
- Set environment variables used by the `flask` command
- Install gcc and other dependencies
- Copy `requirements.txt` and install the Python dependencies
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
- Copy the current directory `.` in the project to the workdir `.` in the image
- Set the default command for the container to `flask run`

## 4. Define services in a Compose file

Create a file `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

This Compose file defines two services: `web` and `redis`

### 4.1 Web service

The `web` service uses an image that’s build from the `Dockerfile` in the current directory. It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port 5000 (the default port for the flask web server)

### 4.2 Redis service

The `redis` service uses a public Redis imges `redis:alpine`

## 5. Build and run your app with Compose

1. From the project directory, start up app by running `docker compose up`

   ```sh
   $ docker compose up 
   ```

   Compose pull a Redis iamge, builds an image for you code, and starts the services you defined. In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time

2. Use curl to test

   ```sh
   $ curl http://localhost:5000/
   Hello World! I have been seen 3 times.
   ```

3. Switch to another terminal window, and type `docker image ls `

   ```sh
   $ docker image ls
   REPOSITORY                       TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
   docker-compose-get-started_web   latest       da30493291c0   About an hour ago   183MB
   python                           3.7-alpine   a1034fd13493   2 weeks ago         41.8MB
   redis                            alpine       3900abf41552   2 weeks ago         32.4MB
   ```

4. Stop the application, either by running `docker-compose down` from within your project directory in the second terminal, or by hitting CTRL+C in the original terminal where you started the app

   ```sh
   $ docker compose down
   [+] Running 3/3
    ⠿ Container docker-compose-get-started-web-1    Removed                     10.3s
    ⠿ Container docker-compose-get-started-redis-1  Removed                      0.2s
    ⠿ Network docker-compose-get-started_default    Removed                      0.1s
   ```

可以看到使用 `docker compose down` 之后会将 `container` 和 `network` 删除，若使用 CTRL+C 只会删除容器而网络将不会被删除

## 6. Edit the Compose file to add a bind mount

Edit `docker-compose.yml` ito add a bind mount for the `web` service:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

The `volumes` key mounts the project directory on the host to `/code` inside the container, allowing you to modify the code on the fly, without having to rebuild the image. The `environment` key sets the `FLASK_NEW` environment variable, which tells `flask run` to run in development mode and reload the code on change. This mode should only be used in development

## 7. Re-build and run the app with Compose

From project directory, run `docker compose up`

```sh
$ docker compose up
```

## 8. Update the application

Because the application code is now mounted into the container using a volume, you can make changes to its code and see the changes instantly, without having to rebuild the image.

Change the greeting in `app.py` and save it. For example, change the `Hello World!` message to `Hello from Docker!`:

```python
return 'Hello from Docker! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

```sh
$ curl 'http://localhost:5000'
Hello from Docker! I have been seen 1 times.
```

## 9. Experiment with some other commands

You can pass the `-d` flag (`detached` mode ) to `docker compose up` and use `docker compose ps` to see what is currently running:

```sh
$ docker compose up -d 
# ...
$ docker compose ps
NAME                                 COMMAND                  SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
docker-compose-get-started-redis-1   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   redis               running             6379/tcp
docker-compose-get-started-web-1     "flask run"              web                 running             0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp, :::5000->5000/tcp
```

The `docker compose run ` command allows you to run one-off commands for your services. For example, to see what environment variables are available to the `web` service

```sh
$ docker compose run web env
```

If you started Compose with `docker compose up -d`, stop your services once you’ve finished with them

```sh
$ docker compose stop
```

You can bring everything down, removing the containers entirely, with the `down` command. Pass `--volumes` to also remove the data volume used by the Redis container

```sh
$ docker compose down --volumes
```
