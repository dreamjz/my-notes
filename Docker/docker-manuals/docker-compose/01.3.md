# Environment variables in Compose

本节代码参见[compose-test]()

## 1. Substitute environment variables in Compose files

It’s possible to use environment varibles in your shell to populate values inside a Compose file:

```yaml
web: 
  image: "webapp:${TAG}"
```

If you have multiple environment variables, you can substitute them by adding them to a default environment variable file named `.env` or by providing a path to your enviroment variables file using the `--env-file` command line option

If an environment variable is not set, Compose substitutues with an empty string. In the example above, if `TAG` is not set, the value for the `image` option is `webapp:`

 You can set default values for environment variables using a `.env` file, which Compose automatically looks for in project directory (parent folder of your Compose file). Values set in the shell enviroment override those set in the `.env` file

> #### Note when using docker stack deploy
>
> The `.env file` feature only works when you use the `docker-compose up` command and does not work with `docker stack deploy`.

Both `$VARIABLE` and `${VARIABLE}` syntax are supported. Additionally when using the [2.1 file format](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-21), it is possible to provide inline default values using typical shell syntax:

- `${VARIBALE:-default}`: evaluates to `default` if `VARIABLE` is **uset or empty** in the environment
- `${VARIABLE-default}`: evaluates to `default` only if `VARIABLE` is **unset** in the environment

Other extended shell-syntax features, such as `${VARIABLE/foo/bar}`, are not supported

You can use a `$$` (double-dollar sign) when your configuration needs a literal dollar sign. This also prevents Compose from interpolating a value, so a `$$` allows you to refer to enviroment variables that you don’t want processed by Compose

```yaml
web:
  build: .
  command: "$$VAR_NOT_INTERPOLATED_BY_COMPOSE"
```

If you foget and use a single dollar sign, Compose interprets the value as an environment variable and warns you:

```
The VAR_NOT_INTERPOLATED_BY_COMPOSE is not set. Substituting an empty string.
```

## 2. `.env` file

You can set default values for any environment variables referenced in the Compose file, or used to configure Compose, in an environment file named `.env`. The path is as follows:

- Starting with `+v1.28`, `.env` file is placed at the base of the project directory
- Project directory can be explicitly defined with the `--file` option or `COMPOSE_FILE` environment variable. Otherwise, it is the current working directory where the `docker compose` command is executed (`+1.28`).
- For previous versions, it might have trouble resolving `.env` file with `--file` or `COMPOSE_FILE`. To work around it, it is recommended to use `--project-directory`, which overrides the path for the `.env` file. This inconsistency is addressed in `+v1.28` by limiting the filepath to the project directory

You can verify this with the config command, which prints your resolved application config to the terminal

```sh
$ docker compose config
```

Values in the shell take precedence over those specified in the `.env` file

If you set `TAG` to a different value in your shell, the substitution uses that instead

### 2.1 Using the `--env-file` option

You can override the environment file path using a command line argument `--env-file`

By passing the file as an argument, you can store it anywhere and name it appropriately, for example `.env.ci`, `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`. Passing the file path is done using the `--env-file` option:

```sh
$ docker compose --env-file ./.env.prod config
```

When an invalid file path is being passed as `--env-file` argument, Compose returns an error:

```sh
$ docker-compose --env-file ./doesnotexist/.env.dev  config
ERROR: Couldn't find env file: /home/user/./doesnotexist/.env.dev
```

## 3. Set environment variables in containers

You can set environment variables in a service’s containers with the `environment` key 

```yaml
web:
  environment:
    - DEBUG=1
```

### 3.1 Pass environment variables to containers

ou can pass environment variables from your shell straight through to a service’s containers with the `environment` by not giving them a value, just like with `docker run -e VARIABLE ...`:

```yaml
web:
  environment:
    - DEBUG
```

The value of the `DEBUG` variable in the container is taken from the value for the same variable in the shell in which Compose is run.
