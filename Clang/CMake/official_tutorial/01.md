## 1. Introduction

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build system issues that CMake helps address. 

## 2. Step 1: A Basic Starting Point

The most basic project is an executable built from source code files. For simple projects, a three line `CMakeLists.txt` file is all that is required. This will be the starting point for our tutorial. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file that looks like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# set the project name
project(Tutorial)

# add the executable 
add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cxx)
```

Note that this example uses lower case commands in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Upper, lower, and mixed case commands are supported by CMake. The source code for `tutorial.cxx` is provided and can be used to compute the square root of a number.

```c++
// tutorial.cxx
// A simple program that computes the squrare root of a number
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if(argc < 2) {
        std::cout << "Usage: " << argv[0] << "number" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    // convert input to double
    const double inputValue = atof(argv[1]);
    
    // calculate square root
    const double outputValue = sqrt(inputValue);
    std::cout << "The square root of " << inputValue << " is " << outputValue
             << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```c
// tutorial.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if(argc < 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s number",argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    
    // convert input to double
    const double inputValue = atof(argv[1]);
    
    // calculate square root
    const double ouputValue = sqrt(inputValue);
    printf("The square root of %f is %f", inputValue, ouputValue);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### 2.1 Build and Run

That’s all that is needed - we can build and our project now.

1. Run the `cmake` executable or the `cmake-gui` to configure the project and then build it with your chosen build tool. 

   ```sh
   mkdir step1_build
   ```

2. Navigate to the build directory and run CMake to configure the project and generate a native build system:

   ```sh
   cd step1_build
   cmake ../step1
   ```

3. Call that build system to actually compile/link the project:

   ```sh
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Try to use the newly built `Tutorial` with these commands:

   ```sh
   Tutorial 9
   Tutorial 10
   Tutorial 
   ```

### 2.2 Adding a Version Number and Configured Header File

The first feature we will add is to provide our executable and project with a version number. While we could do this exclusively in the source code, using `CMakeLists.txt` provides more flexibility.

1. Modify the `CMakeLists.txt` file to use the `project()` command to set the project name and version number.

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
   
   # set the project name and version
   project(Tutorial VERSION 1.0)
   ```

2. Configure a header file to pass the version number to the source code:

   ```cmake
   configure_file(TutorialConfig.h.in TutorialConfig.h)
   ```

3. Since the configured file will be written into the binary tree, we must add that directory to the list of paths to search for include files. Add the following lines to the end of the `CMakeLists.txt` file:

   ```cmake
   target_include_directories(Tutorial PUBLIC "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}")
   ```

4. Create `TutorialConfig.h.in` in the source directory with the following contents:

   ```c
   // the configured options and settings for Tutorial
   #define Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR @Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR@
   #define Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR @Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR@
   ```

   When CMake configures this header file the values for `@Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR@` and `@Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR@` will be replaced.

5. Modify `tutorial.cxx` to include the configured header file, `TutorialConfig.h`

6. Print out the executable name and version number by updating `tutorial.cxx` as follows:

   ```c++
   if(argc < 2) {
           // report version
           std::cout << argv[0] << " Version " << Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR << "."
                     << Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR << std::endl;
           std::cout << "Usage: " << argv[0] << "number" << std::endl;
           return 1;
   }
   ```

### 2.3 Specify the C++ Standard

Let’s add some C++11 features to our project by replacing `atof` with `std::stod` in `tutorial.cxx`. At the same time, remove `#include <cstdlib>`.

```c++
const double inputValue = std::stod(argv[1]);
```

We will need to explicitly state in the CMake code that it should use the correct flags. The easiest way to enable support for a specific C++ standard in CMake is by using `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` variable. 

For this tutorial, set the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` variable in the `CMakeLists.txt` file to `11` and `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED` to `True`. **Make sure to add the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` declarations *above* the call to `add_executable`**.

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)
```

### 2.4 Rebuild

Let’s build our project again. We already created a build directory and ran CMake, so we can skip to the build step:

```sh
cd Step1_build
cmake --build
```

Now we can check that the version number is now reported when running the executable without any arguments.

## 3. Step 2: Adding a Library

Now we will add a library to our project. This library will contain our own implementation for computing the square root of a number. The executable can then use this library instead of the standard square root function provide by the compiler.

For this tutorial we will put the library into a subdirectory called `MathFunctions`. This directory already contains a header file, `MathFunctions.h`, and a source file `mysqrt` that provides similar functionality to the compiler’s `sqrt` function.

Add the following one line `CMakeLists.txt` file to the `MathFunctions` directory:

```cmake
add_library(MathFunctions mysqrt.cxx)
```

To make use of the new library we will add an `add_subdirectory()` call in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file so that the library will get built. We add the new library to the executable, and add `MathFunctions` as an include directory so that the `mysqrt.h` header file can be found. The  top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file should now look like:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

# set the project name and version
project(Tutorial VERSION 1.0)

configure_file(TutorialConfig.h.in TutorialConfig.h)

# specify the C++ standard
# should be above the call of add_executable
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

# add the MathFunctions library
add_subdirectory(MathFunctions)

# add the executable 
add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cxx)

# link libm
# should be after add_executable
target_link_libraries(Tutorial m)


# should be end of CMakeLists file
# add the binary tree to the search path for include files
# so that we will find TutorialConfig.h
target_include_directories(Tutorial PUBLIC "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}" 
                            "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/MathFunctions")
```

Now let us make the `MathFunctions` library optional. While for the tutorial there really isn’t any need to do so, for larger project this is a common occurrence. The first step is to add an option to the top-level `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
```
